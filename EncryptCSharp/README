This is one of my favorite projects. For an assignment for the Southern New
Hampshire University course, MAT-230: Discrete Mathematics, we had to study
an RSA encryption algorithm, write a discussion post on what we had learned
and enjoyed from that algorithm, then encrypt our discussion posts using the
encryption we learned. Rather than crunch the math over and over, I opted to 
instead write this script.

This script will allow the user to encrypt and decrypt messages with the
appropriate RSA encryption method, then print the encrypted or decrypted
messages. Of course, given how RSA encryption works, this only works with
that specific discussion post and the encryption key is not randomly generated,
but it was a great exercise and got me particularly excited for math. That
was a surprise.
