This is a collection of programs I have worked on during my time at Southern New Hampshire University.
At present, it contains project 3, the grocery-tracking application; after this term has ended, more
projects will be added as they're done.

Each folder contains its own README with an explanation of what the project is, what it does, and why
it was done.
