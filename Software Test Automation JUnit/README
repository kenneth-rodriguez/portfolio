- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure software functionality and security, it's important to test early and test often. By checking
for issues early in development and solving problems before they've had a chance to grow and obscure
themselves, developers ensure that software functions as intended, as quickly as possible, and at a low 
cost.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret user needs, it's important to consider the context of the final product. By defining what
the application should look like and do, it becomes easier to change how each feature is implemented
based on user demand; this establishes user requirements. After requirements are definted, they can be
more specifically refined with whiteboarding and diagramming, then implemented into software to work
towards the complete program.

- How do I approach designing software?
Designing software begins with the program's intended purpose. The type of application should affect
the application's flow between menus; for a bank program, a login page should be necessary and a user
database could be used to maintain that user's account information, but a game application might not
have either of these features. After establishing purpose, UML diagramming and whiteboarding can be
used to build the project's structure, then UI design to reflect that structure, then finally setting
up the relationships between UI, classes, and variables before launching the project. Software design
should be deliberate and incremental, with multiple tests taking place in each stage to ensure stability.
