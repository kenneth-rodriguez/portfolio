Here are a few examples of algorithms being used to store information in a variety of data structures,
such as hash tables or trees. I studied these and applied these algorithms in Southern New Hampshire 
University's course, CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms. This was a great course, I'm still fairly
regularly applying the concepts learned in my study of theory and I'm excited to apply what I've learned
in this course to practical work in the field.
