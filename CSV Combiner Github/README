CSV Combiner Script for PMG

As part of the PMG interview process, I was tasked with writing a command line script that was capable of combining multiple
CSV files into a single CSV document with the original filenames tacked on to the end. Somewhat pressed for time (gotta love
finals), I feel like the script in its current state provides a good foundation that would lend itself to the ever-iterative
software development lifecycle.

Commands can be executed as such:
./csv-combiner.py ./fixtures/[CSV HERE]
and the application should readily handle as many CSVs as you can throw at it. Ideally. As per instructions, unit tests are
included, thank you for your time, and I hope you have a great day!
